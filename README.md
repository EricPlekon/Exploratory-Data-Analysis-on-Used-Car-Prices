# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Used-Car-Prices

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of used car prices. The purpose of this analysis is to uncover trens, relationships, and insights that can help in understanding factors affecting car prices in the used car market.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of various features related to used cars such as Model, Year, Price, Transmission, Mileage, Fuel Type, Tax, MPG, and Engine Size.

# Analysis Steps

1) Data Loading - the dataset is loaded into libraries such as pandas
  
2) Data Cleaning - Handling missing values by removing incomplete records or imputing missing values, ensuring data types are correct for further analysis

3) Exploratory Analysis - Exploring individual features like price, mileage, and year through summary statistics to understand their distribution, examining relationships between two variables, such as price vs. mileage, price vs. year using correlation analysis

4) Visualizations - Used heatmap for correlation matrices to highlight the strength od relationships between numerical features

5) Insights/Conclusion - summarized key findings, older cars tend to have lower prices. Cars with automatic transmission generally have higher prices than manual cars
